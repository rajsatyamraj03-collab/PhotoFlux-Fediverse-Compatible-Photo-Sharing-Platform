# PhotoFlux-Fediverse-Compatible-Photo-Sharing-Platform
# 🌍 PhotoFlux – Fediverse Compatible Photo Sharing Platform

Photoflux is a decentralized, Fediverse-compatible photo sharing social media platform built using the ActivityPub protocol.  
It allows local and remote users (e.g., Mastodon users) to follow, interact, and exchange posts across federated servers.

This project demonstrates real-world implementation of distributed systems, federation, and open social networking standards.

---

## 🔥 Why This Project?

Centralized social networks control user data and content.  
Photoflux explores the future of decentralized social media using:

- Federation instead of central servers  
- Open protocols instead of closed APIs  
- Interoperability across platforms (Mastodon, Pleroma, etc.)

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**
>
> If you are using **ngrok** for local development, you must run the following command **every time you restart the application**:
>
> ```bash
> ngrok http 4000
> ```
>
> This is required because ngrok generates a new public URL on each restart, which must be updated in your application configuration (e.g., `BASE_URL`).

## 🔐 Security & Key Management

This project uses **per-user RSA key pairs** for ActivityPub federation. Each user automatically gets their own unique keypair stored securely in the database during registration.

### Key Features
- ✅ **Automatic key generation** - No manual setup required
- ✅ **Database storage** - Keys stored securely in MongoDB
- ✅ **Per-user isolation** - Each actor has unique keys
- ✅ **Username validation** - Prevents undefined or empty usernames

### Important Notes
- **DO NOT** run `genKey.js` - It's deprecated (creates server-wide keys)
- **DO NOT** use `utils/keys.js` - File-based system is deprecated
- Keys are automatically managed by the User model

📖 **For detailed information**, see [KEY_MANAGEMENT.md](./KEY_MANAGEMENT.md)
